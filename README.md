# WordPress REST API jQuery

A lightweight jQuery script for handerling REST API requests developed by [Sébastien Dumont](https://sebastiendumont.com).

> This project is in beta status.

[Documentation](https://docs.restjquery.com/) | [Examples](https://github.com/seb86/WordPress-REST-API-jQuery-Examples)

You can use the [WordPress REST API jQuery Support](https://github.com/seb86/WordPress-REST-API-jQuery-Support) plugin for quick script installation.

This project was created to save time writing more lines of code just to get the returned REST API response via jQuery. Perfect for keeping your own code to a minimum rather than repeating yourself.

If you need help with the script or want to join a community of developers who use the script you can join the Slack channel after paying a fee in your choice of currency. Simply visit [https://restjquery.com](https://restjquery.com) and select **"I would like some support"** and pay.

You will then be invited to the Slack team. Once you have created an account you can ask for help directly or talk with the rest of the community.

If you just want to show some appreciation for the project you can do that too.

If you want to [contribute to the project](https://github.com/seb86/WordPress-REST-API-jQuery/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) you are welcome to do so. Just follow the simple instructions.

I hope you have fun with the project.

Thank you for stopping by.

regards,

Sébastien Dumont.
