## Overview üîî

This project was created to save time writing more lines of code just to get the returned REST API response via jQuery. Perfect for keeping your own code to a minimum rather than repeating yourself.

Perfect for building apps.

<!--If you need help with the script or want to join a community of developers who use the script you can join the Slack channel after paying a fee in your choice of currency. Simply visit [https://restjquery.com](https://restjquery.com) and select **"I would like some support"** and pay.

You will then be invited to the Slack team. Once you have created an account you can ask for help directly or talk with the rest of the community.

If you just want to show some appreciation for the project you can do that too.-->


### Is This Free?

Yes, it's free. But here's what you should _really_ care about:

* It's lightweight. Only 3.04 KB


### What's the Catch?

This is a non-commercial project. As such:

* Development time for it is effectively being donated and is therefore, limited.
* Critical issues may not be resolved promptly.

<!--If you:

* have a customization/integration requirement, or
* want to see another feature added, e.g. support for **eggs** or **donuts**,

...then I'd love to [hear from you](https://sebastiendumont.com/about/)!-->

Please understand that this repository is not a place to seek help with configuration-related issues. Use it to report bugs, propose improvements, or discuss new features.

## Guide üìò

#### Documentation üìñ

* [Documentation](https://docs.restjquery.com/)
* [Examples](https://github.com/seb86/WordPress-REST-API-jQuery-Examples)


#### Requirements ‚úÖ

To use this project you will need:

* WordPress v4.4+


#### Installation üíΩ

If you want to use the script within your WordPress site:

1. Go to WordPress Admin > Plugins > Add New.
2. Search for [WordPress REST API jQuery Support](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-rest-api-jquery-support/).
3. Click Install Now and Activate the plugin.

... or if you wish to use the script in an app while keeping WordPress safe and secure elsewhere:

1. Download the latest release from this Git repository.
2. Copy `wp-rest-api-jquery.min.js` from `dist` folder to your app lib folder.
3. Apply the script either to the header or footer of your app.

```
<script src="https://yourdomain.***/lib/wp-rest-api-jquery.min.js"></script>
```


### Usage

Make sure that when you use the script in your app that you set the `site_url` to the location of WordPress. Otherwise it is NOT required!

```
var posts = restjQuery(
  site_url: "https://wordpress.location"
);
```
