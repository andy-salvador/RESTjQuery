## üîî Overview

This project was created to save time writing more lines of code just to get the returned REST API response via jQuery. Perfect for keeping your own code to a minimum rather than repeating yourself.

Perfect for building web apps.


### Is This Free?

Yes, it's free. But here's what you should _really_ care about:

* It's lightweight. ![GitHub file size in bytes](https://img.shields.io/github/size/restjquery/RESTjQuery/dist/restjquery.min.js.svg?style=flat-square)


Please understand that this repository is not a place to seek help with configuration-related issues. Use it to report bugs, propose improvements, or discuss new features.


## üìò Guide

#### üìñ Documentation

* [Documentation](https://docs.restjquery.com/)
* [Examples](https://github.com/restjquery/examples)


#### ‚úÖ Requirements

To use this project you will need:

* WordPress v4.4 minimum


#### üíΩ Installation

If you want to use the script within your WordPress site:

1. Go to WordPress Admin > Plugins > Add New.
2. Search for [RESTjQuery](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-rest-api-jquery-support/).
3. Click Install Now and Activate the plugin.

... or if you wish to use the script in an app while keeping WordPress safe and secure elsewhere:

1. Download the latest release from this Git repository.
2. Copy `restjquery.min.js` from `dist` folder to your app lib folder.
3. Apply the script either to the head or just before your close body tag of your web app.

```javascript
<script src="https://yourdomain.***/lib/restjquery.min.js"></script>
```

or you can use the latest version directly from restjquery.com

```javascript
<script src="https://restjquery.com/release/latest/restjquery.min.js"></script>
```

### Usage

Make sure that when you use the script in your app that you set the `site_url` to the location of the WordPress site. Otherwise it is NOT required!

```javascript
var posts = restjQuery(
  site_url: "https://wordpress.location"
);
```
