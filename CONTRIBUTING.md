## Contributing to RESTjQuery

### Reporting Issues

Reporting issues is a great way to became a contributor as it doesn't require technical skills. In fact you don't even need to know a programming language or to be able to check the code itself, you just need to make sure that everything works as expected and [submit an issue report](https://github.com/seb86/WordPress-REST-API-jQuery/issues/new) if you spot a bug. Sound like something you're up for? Go for it!

#### How To Submit An Issue Report

If something isn't working, congratulations you've found a bug! Help me fix it by submitting an issue report:

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Search the [Existing Issues](https://github.com/seb86/WordPress-REST-API-jQuery/issues) to be sure that the one you've noticed isn't already there.
* Submit a report for your issue by:
  * Clearly describing the issue (including steps to reproduce it if it's a bug).
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.

#### Making Changes

Making changes help improve RESTjQuery. You will need some technical skills to make a change, like knowing a bit of PHP or JavaScript.

If you think something could be improved and you're able to do so, make your changes and submit a Pull Request. I'll be pleased to get it :)

### How to submit a PR
* Fork the repository on GitHub.
* Make the changes to your forked repository.
  * Ensure you use LF line endings - no crazy Windows line endings. :)
* When committing, reference your issue (#1234) and include a note about the fix.
* Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request to the 'master' branch of the RESTjQuery repository.
* Please **don't** modify the changelog - this will be maintained by SÃ©bastien Dumont.

After you follow the steps above, the next stage will be waiting on me to merge your Pull Request. I review them all, and make suggestions and changes as and if necessary.
