# Contribute To WordPress REST API jQuery

Community made patches, bug reports and contributions are always welcome and are crucial.

When contributing please ensure you follow the guidelines below so that I can keep on top of things.

__Please Note:__ GitHub is for *bug reports and contributions only* - if you have a support question or a request for a customization this is not the right place to post it. Use [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/auto-load-next-post) for community support.

If you need help setting up the plugin I do offer [theme support](https://autoloadnextpost.com/product/theme-support/?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=contributing.md).

## Contributing to WordPress REST API jQuery

### Reporting Issues

Reporting issues is a great way to became a contributor as it doesn't require technical skills. In fact you don't even need to know a programming language or to be able to check the code itself, you just need to make sure that everything works as expected and [submit an issue report](https://github.com/AutoLoadNextPost/Auto-Load-Next-Post/issues/new) if you spot a bug. Sound like something you're up for? Go for it!

#### How To Submit An Issue Report

If something isn't working, congratulations you've found a bug! Help me fix it by submitting an issue report:

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Search the [Existing Issues](https://github.com/AutoLoadNextPost/Auto-Load-Next-Post/issues) to be sure that the one you've noticed isn't already there.
* Submit a report for your issue by:
  * Clearly describing the issue (including steps to reproduce it if it's a bug).
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.

#### Making Changes

Making changes help improve WordPress REST API jQuery. You will need some technical skills to make a change, like knowing a bit of PHP or JavaScript.

If you think something could be improved and you're able to do so, make your changes and submit a Pull Request. I'll be pleased to get it :)

If you are making JavaScript changes for the frontend then please [edit the developer version](https://github.com/AutoLoadNextPost/Auto-Load-Next-Post/blob/master/assets/js/frontend/auto-load-next-post.dev.js) "auto-load-next-post.dev.js" of the Javascript. To test with the developer version you need to make sure that you have **ALNP_DEV_DEBUG** set as true in your *wp-config.php* file.

### How to submit a PR
* Fork the repository on GitHub.
* Make the changes to your forked repository.
  * Ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards).
  * Ensure you use LF line endings - no crazy Windows line endings. :)
* When committing, reference your issue (#1234) and include a note about the fix.
* Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request to the 'master' branch of the WordPress REST API jQuery repository. Existing maintained branches will be maintained by Sébastien Dumont.
* Please **don't** modify the changelog - this will be maintained by Sébastien Dumont.
* Please **don't** add your localizations or update the .pot files - this will be maintained by Sébastien Dumont. To contribute to the localization of WordPress REST API jQuery, please join the [translate.wordpress.org project](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/auto-load-next-post). This is much needed, if you speak a language that needs translating consider yourself officially invited to the party.

After you follow the steps above, the next stage will be waiting on me to merge your Pull Request. I review them all, and make suggestions and changes as and if necessary.
